# Fake News Detection Model

A machine learning model designed to classify news articles as **real** or **fake** based on their textual content.

## Project Overview
This project implements a supervised learning approach to detect fake news using natural language processing techniques and classification algorithms.

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Scikit-learn  
- Pandas  
- Numpy  
- NLTK 
- Jupyter Notebook (for experimentation)

## Features
- Text preprocessing: tokenization, stop-word removal, and vectorization (TF-IDF)  
- Model training with classifiers such as Logistic Regression, SVM, or Passive-Aggressive Classifier  
- Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score  
- Prediction function to classify new news articles


## Performance
- Achieved accuracy: 99.5% 
- Model trained and tested on Kaggle datasets of fake.csv and true.csv
